I extended the pbrt system to include a volume photon map integrator, which uses the beam radiance estimate outlined by Jarosz in his 2008 Paper. The volume photons are assigned a radius based on an n-lookup of the closest photons. The ray traced by pbrt is then intersected with these radii, instead of ray marching. This is my first foray into rendering, and I was rather happy with the results, which I will post shortly.
